# reactjs-code-challenge

## Overview

This challenge involves fixing and refactoring a **Dynamic Form** that allows users to **dynamically add** and **remove fields**.

The current implementation has missing `addField` and `removeField` functions, causing the form to be broken.

## Requirements

- **Convert class components** to **functional components** for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Reimplement** the `addField` and `removeField` functions to restore the form's functionality.
- **Refactor** the code to use **React Hooks** for state management and better code clarity.
- **Optional:** Improve the styling for better modularity and maintainability.

## Objective

- Implement dynamic form field management using React.
- Refactor class components or inline state management to functional components and React hooks.
